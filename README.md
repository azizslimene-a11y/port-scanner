# port-scanner
A small, educational multithreaded TCP port scanner written in Python. Resolves a hostname or IP and checks TCP ports (1–65535) concurrently to report open ports. Ideal for learning sockets, threading, and simple CLI tools — not intended for aggressive or unauthorized scanning.
Scans TCP ports 1–65535 for a target hostname or IP.

Simple, readable Python implementation great for learning.

Prints discovered open ports in real time.

Includes caveats and suggested improvements (thread pools, asyncio, CLI flags).
